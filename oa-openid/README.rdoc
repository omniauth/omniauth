= OmniAuth::OpenID

OpenID strategies for the OmniAuth gem.

== Installation

To get just OpenID functionality:

    gem install oa-openid
    
For the full auth suite:

    gem install omniauth
    
== Stand-Alone Example

Use the strategy as a middleware in your application:

    require 'omniauth/openid'
    require 'openid/store/filesystem'
    
    use OmniAuth::Strategies::OpenID, OpenID::Store::Filesystem.new('/tmp')
    
Then simply direct users to '/auth/open_id' to prompt them for their OpenID identifier. You may also pre-set the identifier by passing an <tt>identifier</tt> parameter to the URL (Example: <tt>/auth/open_id?openid_url=https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id</tt>).

== OmniAuth Builder

If OpenID is one of several authentication strategies, use the OmniAuth Builder:

    require 'omniauth/openid'
    require 'omniauth/basic'  # for Campfire
    require 'openid/store/filesystem'
    
    use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :open_id, OpenID::Store::Filesystem.new('/tmp')
      provider :campfire
    end
